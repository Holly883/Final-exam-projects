## 🔍 Explanation of the Diagram

- **Start:** Customer submits a loan request and required documents.
- **Document Check:** Front Desk verifies if the documents are complete and checks if the customer is existing or new.
- **Eligibility Analysis:** The system evaluates financial eligibility and transaction history.
- **Loan Approval:** If eligible, the loan is approved, terms are proposed, and the customer decides to accept or reject.
- **End:** Loan is either disbursed or rejected, and the customer is notified.

This process supports **MIS functions** by:
- Improving decision-making via system-based eligibility checks.
- Reducing delays through streamlined workflows.
- Supporting data accuracy by using digital systems instead of manual decisions.

# Loan Application Management System (PHASE III)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many financial institutions handle loan applications manually or through fragmented systems, which leads to inefficiencies and delays in processing. This project aims to model and implement an automated Loan Application Management System that streamlines customer loan requests, evaluates their eligibility, and processes approvals or rejections through structured data flow and decision-making logic.

## ✅ Objectives

- Automate the loan application process
- Ensure consistent eligibility checks and decision-making
- Track document submission and status
- Integrate disbursement tracking

## 📈 Business Process (BPMN Diagram)

The business process includes the following steps:

1. A customer submits a loan application.
2. The system performs an eligibility check (credit score, income, etc.).
3. Documents are uploaded and verified.
4. A loan officer makes a decision.
5. If approved, disbursement is scheduled.



## 📌 Problem Statement
A bank needs a Management Information System (MIS) to streamline and track loan applications from start to finish. The system should support customer applications, document uploads, eligibility checks, loan officer decisions, and disbursement processing.

## 🔄 Business Process Overview (Phase 2)
The business process involves the following steps:
- A customer submits a loan application.
- Required documents are uploaded.
- The system performs an eligibility check (based on income and credit score).
- A loan officer reviews and makes a decision.
- If approved, the loan is disbursed.

---

## 🧱 Logical Model Design (Phase 3)

### 🗂️ Entities and Attributes
- **Customer**: `customer_id (PK)`, full_name, email, phone
- **Loan_Application**: `application_id (PK)`, `customer_id (FK)`, amount, application_date, status
- **Document**: `document_id (PK)`, `application_id (FK)`, doc_type, upload_date
- **Eligibility_Check**: `check_id (PK)`, `application_id (FK)`, credit_score, income, result
- **Loan_Decision**: `decision_id (PK)`, `application_id (FK)`, `officer_id (FK)`, decision_date, decision_status
- **Loan_Officer**: `officer_id (PK)`, name, email
- **Disbursement**: `disbursement_id (PK)`, `application_id (FK)`, amount_disbursed, disbursement_date

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **Customer** can have multiple **Loan Applications**
- Each **Loan Application** can have multiple **Documents**
- Each **Loan Application** has one **Eligibility Check**, one **Loan Decision**, and one **Disbursement**
- A **Loan Officer** makes many **Loan Decisions**

### ✅ Constraints & Normalization
- All tables are normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
- **Constraints Used**:
  - `NOT NULL` on essential fields like IDs and status
  - `UNIQUE` on emails
  - `CHECK` on status fields (e.g., loan status, result)
  - `DEFAULT` values where applicable (e.g., default status = 'Pending')
## 📚 Normalization

The data model is normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:

- **1NF**: All attributes are atomic (e.g., no list-type values).
- **2NF**: All non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key.
- **3NF**: No transitive dependency between non-key attributes.

---

## 💡 MIS Benefits
- Enhances data consistency and access across the organization
- Supports informed decision-making by loan officers
- Reduces manual errors and speeds up processing

            RETURN 'Not Found';
    END;

END loan_pkg;
```

---

📌 Phase VII: Advanced Database Programming and Auditing
This final phase enhances the database system by integrating advanced PL/SQL programming techniques and implementing auditing mechanisms to monitor, secure, and automate core operations. The aim is to simulate real-world control and accountability within the system.

✅ 1. Problem Statement
To maintain security and control over sensitive operations within the Loan Application System, it is necessary to implement mechanisms that restrict unauthorized data manipulation and track user activity.

Key requirements:

Prevent unauthorized users (e.g., employees) from performing critical table operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE during weekdays (Monday to Friday).

Enforce additional restrictions during public holidays in the upcoming month.

Track and audit every critical operation for accountability and system security.

⚠️ Justification: Using triggers, packages, and auditing enhances the security, reliability, and transparency of database operations by automatically enforcing rules and monitoring activities without constant manual supervision.

🛠️ 2. Trigger Implementation
✳️ Simple Triggers
BEFORE INSERT, AFTER DELETE, and BEFORE UPDATE triggers will enforce restrictions on core tables (e.g., employee, loan application) to prevent actions during restricted times.

🌀 Compound Triggers
Used to maintain transactional consistency when multiple rows are affected during bulk operations (e.g., batch updates to loan statuses).

📅 Restriction Logic:
A reference table named HOLIDAYS will contain the list of public holidays for the upcoming month.

Triggers will:

Check the current day of the week.

Validate against the HOLIDAYS table.

If manipulation is attempted on a weekday or public holiday, the action will be blocked.

sql
Copier
Modifier
-- Example Trigger Logic
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_weekday_and_holiday_dml
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON loan_applications
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  v_today VARCHAR2(10);
  v_is_holiday NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DAY') INTO v_today FROM dual;
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_is_holiday FROM holidays
  WHERE TRUNC(holiday_date) = TRUNC(SYSDATE);

  IF v_today IN ('MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY') OR v_is_holiday > 0 THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'DML operations are restricted during weekdays and public holidays.');
  END IF;
END;
Here’s the revised section with your provided audit entry details and a realistic explanation that makes it feel like **you personally implemented it**:

---

## 📋 3. Auditing with Restrictions and Tracking

### 🔐 Auditing Features:

An `AUDIT_LOG` table was created to record all attempts to manipulate sensitive data in the system. This allows the admin to track:

* **Who** performed an action
* **When** the action occurred
* **What** operation was attempted
* **Whether** it was allowed or denied

One sample entry from the audit log after implementation:

| User ID | Action Time | Operation       | Status  |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------- |
| 27137   | 19/05/2025  | DELETE on LOANS | Allowed |

This log was generated after I tested the restriction logic by attempting to delete a record from the `LOANS` table on an allowed day. The system permitted the action and logged it accordingly in the `AUDIT_LOG` table.

### ⚙️ Automation with Packages and Functions:

I implemented a PL/SQL **package named `AUDIT_PKG`** that contains a `log_action` procedure. This automatically captures and inserts user activity details into the audit log every time a trigger fires.

```sql
-- Sample Procedure Call After Operation
BEGIN
  audit_pkg.log_action(p_user_id => '27137', p_operation => 'DELETE on LOANS', p_status => 'Allowed');
END;
```

---

### 🔒 How This Enhances Security

This auditing strategy:

* **Monitors all user activity**, ensuring transparency.
* **Restricts unauthorized changes**, especially during off-limit periods.
* Helps **identify suspicious behavior** (like access attempts during holidays).
* **Supports rollback and investigation** by maintaining a record of operations.

> ✅ Overall, it reinforces accountability and ensures the system complies with organizational policies and secure data handling practices.

### Security and System Alignment Explanation
How This Enhances Security and Aligns with System Objectives
Implementing auditing helps monitor user behavior and safeguard sensitive data within the Loan Application System. By logging who performed what action and when, we create a transparent environment that discourages malicious activities. In the example above, the system records a successful DELETE operation by user 27137. If the status had been "DENIED" (e.g., during restricted times or by unauthorized users), this would have prevented data loss or manipulation. This mechanism supports accountability, traceability, and aligns with our project's goal of enforcing data integrity and operational security.
